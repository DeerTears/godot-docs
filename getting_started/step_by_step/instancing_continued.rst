Instancing (continued)
======================

Recap
-----

Instancing has many handy uses. At a glance, with instancing you have:

-  The ability to subdivide scenes and make them easier to manage.
-  A tool to manage and edit multiple node instances at once.
-  A way to organize and embed complex game flows or even UI (in Godot, UI
   Elements are nodes too)

Instancing scenes using code
----------------------------

In GDScript, we can add "export" before any variable to have it appear
in the inspector window. This is often used for integers and other types
of variables, but we can also export variables that hold objects.
By clarifying the exported variable as a PackedScene, the script
is able to embed scenes into its code, letting us instance them.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript
	
	# Let the editor adjust this PackedScene variable.
    export (PackedScene) var MyScene

This example uses "MyScene" as the name for the Script Variable,
but this name can be changed, and more Script Variables could be added.

Try adding this to your root node of a new project and look at your
inspector window, you'll see a new segment at the top. These are the
"Script Variables" and changing these in-editor will change what our
code is referring to. Because the variable is a PackedScene type,
we can click on the empty slot and load the scene we want to instantiate
using the inspector window. Keep this in mind as your "original"
version of the scene that will be cloned later on.

Now that we have the export code written - and our script has a scene
attached to the variable - we want to make a copy of the original scene
so it can be placed in our game. This example uses "clone" as the name
for the copy, but this name could be anything else.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript
	
	# Copy our originally-loaded Script Variable scene.
	var clone = MyScene.instance()
	
We create a new variable that will be our clone, set it to the original,
and finally use the "instance()" function in our PackedScene to clone it.

From here, we can call upon this clone and change its properties.
.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

	# Any other properties from the original scene can be adjusted here.
    clone.position = Vector2(0, 0)
	clone.name = ("Godot")

When we're finally done setting up our clone, we have to add it to the
SceneTree using the following line:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    add_child(clone)

Just remember to have a way to remove the node when it's no longer needed.
This could be done by using the original scene's script, and adding a
conditional statement that ends in "queue_free()".

Ultimately, our code to instance a scene looks like this:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript
    
	export (PackedScene) var MyScene
	var clone = MyScene.instance() #create a clone of the original PackedScene
	
	clone.position = Vector2(0, 0)
	clone.name = ("Godot")
    add_child(clone) #add to the SceneTree

And don't forget to load the scene you want instantiated in the inspector!

Design language
---------------

The greatest strength that comes with instancing scenes is that it works
as an excellent design language. This distinguishes Godot
from other engines.

When making games with Godot, the recommended approach is to dismiss most
common design patterns, such as MVC or Entity-Relationship diagrams, and
instead think about your scenes in a more natural way. Start by imagining the
visible elements in your game, the ones that can be named not just by a
programmer, but by anyone.

For example, here's how a simple shooter game could be imagined:

.. image:: img/shooter_instancing.png

You can come up with a diagram like this for almost any kind
of game. Write down the parts of the game that you can visualize, and then
add arrows to represent ownership of one component by another.

Once you have a diagram like this, the recommended process for making a game is
to create a scene for each element listed in the diagram. You'll use instancing
(either by code or directly in the editor) for the ownership relationships.

A lot of time spent in programming games (or software in general) is on
designing an architecture and fitting game components to that architecture.
Designing based on scenes replaces that approach and makes development much
faster and more straightforward, allowing you to concentrate on the game logic
itself. Because most game components map directly to a scene, using a design based on scene instantiation means little other architectural code is needed.

Let's take a look at one more, somewhat more complex, example of an open-world
type game with lots of assets and nested elements:

.. image:: img/openworld_instancing.png

Take a look at the room element. Let's say we started there. We could make a
couple of different room scenes, with different arrangements of furniture (also
scenes) in them. Later, we could make a house scene, connecting rooms to make
up its interior.

Then, we could make a citadel scene, which is made out of many instanced
houses. Then, we could start working on the world map terrain, adding the
citadel onto it.

Later, we could create scenes that represent guards (and other NPCs) and add
them to the citadel as well. As a result, they would be indirectly added to the
overall game world.

With Godot, it's easy to iterate on your game like this, as all you need to do
is create and instance more scenes. Furthermore, the editor UI is designed to be user
friendly for programmers and non-programmers alike. A typical team development
process can involve 2D or 3D artists, level designers, game designers,
and animators, all working with the editor interface.

Information overload!
---------------------

This has been a lot of high level information dropped on you all at once. However, the important part of this tutorial was to create an awareness of how scenes and instancing are used in real projects.

Everything discussed here will become second nature to you once you start making games and putting these concepts into practice. For now, donâ€™t worry about it too much, and go on to the next tutorial!
